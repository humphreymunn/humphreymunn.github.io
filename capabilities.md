## Research Capabilities

- **Real-robot experimentation:** deployment, calibration, and debugging of learning-based controllers on legged and humanoid robots (including commercial and in-house platforms); diagnosis of hardware–software interaction failures; hands-on maintenance and repair of robotic platforms.
- **Robotics software systems:** development of C++ and ROS-based control, sensing, and logging pipelines for real-robot deployment and experimentation.
- **Sim-to-real pipelines:** large-scale simulation, domain randomization, system identification, and transfer of learned policies to physical platforms.
- **Machine learning expertise:** end-to-end development of machine learning models, including representation learning, optimisation, probabilistic modelling, and large-scale training for robotics applications.
- **High-performance computing:** large-scale RL training and evaluation on HPC clusters; experiment orchestration, logging, and failure recovery.
- **Learning-based control:** reinforcement learning for whole-body control, multi-objective optimisation, and safety-aware deployment.
- **Failure analysis & diagnostics:** out-of-distribution detection, anomaly diagnosis, and post-hoc attribution for real-world robotic failures.
- **Motion capture & evaluation:** use of motion-capture systems for state estimation, trajectory reconstruction, and quantitative evaluation of real-robot behaviour.
